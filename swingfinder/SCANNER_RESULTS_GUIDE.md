# 📊 Scanner Results Guide: What to Expect

## 🎯 Your Question:
> "How many results would be a good pull and out of those results should I expect to actually be usable?"

---

## 📈 **Realistic Expectations**

### **Total Results (Good Pull):**
**Recommended: 50-150 results**

- **50-75 results:** Conservative, high-quality focus
- **75-120 results:** Sweet spot for building a solid watchlist
- **120-200 results:** Maximum coverage, more filtering needed

**Why this range?**
- The U.S. market has ~8,000 tradable stocks
- On any given day, only **1-3%** will have quality setups
- That's roughly **80-240 stocks** meeting basic criteria
- Your filters narrow this down to the best opportunities

---

### **Usable Results (Actually Tradable):**
**Expect: 10-30% to be truly usable**

| Total Results | Usable Setups | Percentage |
|---------------|---------------|------------|
| 50 results    | 10-15 trades  | 20-30%     |
| 100 results   | 15-25 trades  | 15-25%     |
| 150 results   | 20-30 trades  | 13-20%     |
| 200 results   | 25-40 trades  | 12-20%     |

**Why only 10-30%?**
1. **Market conditions change** - Setup looks good at scan time, but market shifts
2. **Timing matters** - Some need to "cook" longer before entry
3. **Risk/reward varies** - Not all 2:1 R/R setups are equal
4. **Personal preference** - You won't like every stock's chart pattern
5. **Capital limits** - You can't trade everything

## 🎚️ **Filter Sensitivity Impact**

Your scanner has a **sensitivity slider (1-5)** that dramatically affects results:

### **Sensitivity Level 1 (Very Strict):**
- **Results:** 20-50 stocks
- **Usable:** 30-40% (10-20 trades)
- **Quality:** Highest - mostly A/B grade setups
- **Best for:** Small accounts, conservative traders, choppy markets

### **Sensitivity Level 2 (Strict):**
- **Results:** 40-80 stocks
- **Usable:** 25-35% (15-25 trades)
- **Quality:** High - mostly B/C grade setups
- **Best for:** Quality over quantity approach

### **Sensitivity Level 3 (Balanced) ⭐ RECOMMENDED:**
- **Results:** 80-150 stocks
- **Usable:** 20-30% (20-35 trades)
- **Quality:** Good mix - B/C/D grade setups
- **Best for:** Most traders, building watchlists

### **Sensitivity Level 4 (Relaxed):**
- **Results:** 120-200 stocks
- **Usable:** 15-25% (25-40 trades)
- **Quality:** Mixed - C/D grade setups with some gems
- **Best for:** Aggressive traders, strong markets

### **Sensitivity Level 5 (Very Relaxed):**
- **Results:** 200-300+ stocks
- **Usable:** 10-20% (30-50 trades)
- **Quality:** Lower - D/F grade setups mixed in
- **Best for:** Maximum coverage, experienced traders who can filter manually

## 📊 **Smart Score Distribution**

After a typical scan with **Sensitivity 3**, here's what to expect:

| Smart Score | Grade | % of Results | Usability |
|-------------|-------|--------------|-----------|
| 80-100      | A     | 5-10%        | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Excellent - Trade immediately |
| 70-79       | B     | 15-20%       | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Good - Strong candidates |
| 60-69       | C     | 30-40%       | ⭐⭐⭐ Decent - Watch for confirmation |
| 50-59       | D     | 25-30%       | ⭐⭐ Marginal - Need more work |
| 0-49        | F     | 10-15%       | ⭐ Weak - Avoid or wait |

**Example:** 100 results
- **A grade (80-100):** 5-10 stocks → **TRADE THESE**
- **B grade (70-79):** 15-20 stocks → **Strong watchlist**
- **C grade (60-69):** 30-40 stocks → **Monitor for improvement**
- **D/F grade (<60):** 35-45 stocks → **Skip or wait**

**Usable = A + B grades = 20-30 stocks out of 100**

---

## 🎯 **Recommended Workflow**

### **Step 1: Run Scanner with Optimal Settings**
```
Setup Mode: Both (Breakout + Pullback)
Sensitivity: 3 (Balanced)
Price Range: $10-$60
Min Volume: 1,000,000
Max Cards: 120
Fibonacci Filter: OFF (default)
```

**Expected:** 80-120 results

---

### **Step 2: Sort by Smart Score**
- Focus on **top 30-40 stocks** (highest Smart Score)
- These are your **A and B grade** setups

---

### **Step 3: Filter by Tabs**
- **✅ Confirmed Setups tab:** Ready to trade NOW (60-80% of results)
- **🟡 Near Misses tab:** Watch for confirmation (20-40% of results)

---

### **Step 4: Apply Fibonacci Filter (Optional)**
- Enable **"💎 Only show Discount Zone entries"**
- Cuts results by **40-60%**
- Shows only best risk/reward entries (0-50% Fib)

**Example:**
- Before: 100 results
- After: 40-60 results (all in discount zone)
- Usable: 15-25 trades (25-40% of filtered results)

---

### **Step 5: Analyze Top Candidates**
1. **Click "Analyze"** on top 10-15 stocks
2. **Review charts** - Do you like the pattern?
3. **Check Fibonacci levels** - Is entry price favorable?
4. **Read AI coaching prompt** - Does setup make sense?
5. **Add to watchlist** - Keep 5-10 best setups

---

### **Step 6: Set Alerts**
- **Top 3-5 setups:** Set price alerts for entry
- **Next 5-10 setups:** Set alerts for confirmation
- **Monitor daily:** Check which alerts trigger

---

## 💡 **Pro Tips for Maximizing Usability**

### **1. Adjust for Market Conditions**
- **Strong market (SPY uptrend):** Use Sensitivity 4-5, focus on Breakouts
- **Weak market (SPY downtrend):** Use Sensitivity 1-2, focus on Pullbacks
- **Choppy market:** Use Sensitivity 2-3, enable Fibonacci filter

### **2. Use Smart Mode**
- Enables **sector rotation analysis**
- Boosts Smart Score for stocks in strong sectors
- Increases usability by **10-15%**

### **3. Focus on Confirmed Setups**
- **Confirmed tab** has 2-3x higher usability than Near Misses
- Near Misses need more time to develop

### **4. Prioritize Discount Zone**
- Stocks with **💎 Discount Entry** badge have better risk/reward
- **38.2-50% Fib zone** is the sweet spot
- Avoid **⚠️ Premium Zone** entries (>78.6% Fib)

### **5. Don't Trade Everything**
- **Quality > Quantity**
- Better to trade 5 excellent setups than 20 mediocre ones
- Focus on **A and B grade** Smart Scores
