## 💡 **HOW IT WORKS**

### **Two-Stage Filtering:**

**Stage 1: Universe (275 stocks)**
- Pre-filtered list of quality stocks
- Removes junk tickers before scanning
- Saves API calls and time

**Stage 2: Scanner (your $10-$60 filter)**
- Scans the 275 quality stocks
- Applies YOUR price/volume filters in real-time
- Only shows stocks in $10-$60 range with 1M+ volume

### **Result:**
You get **ONLY stocks that meet BOTH criteria:**
1. ✅ Quality stock (in the 275 universe)
2. ✅ In your $10-$60 range with 1M+ volume

## 🚀 **DOES THIS LIMIT YOU?**

### **Short Answer: NO!**

Here's why:

### **1. Dynamic Filtering**
- The 275 stocks is your **starting universe**
- The scanner **filters in real-time** based on current prices
- As stocks move in/out of $10-$60, they automatically qualify

### **2. Plenty of Opportunities**
Even with $10-$60 filter, you'll typically have:
- **50-100 stocks** in range at any given time
- **10-30 setups** per scan (depending on market conditions)
- **More than enough** for swing trading (you can only trade 5-10 positions anyway)

### **3. Quality Over Quantity**
- Every stock in your universe is **liquid and tradeable**
- No junk tickers wasting your time
- Every hit is worth looking at

### **4. You Can Adjust Anytime**
In the scanner UI, you can change:
- Min Price (default: $10)
- Max Price (default: $60)
- Min Volume (default: 1M)

Want to scan $5-$100? Just change the sliders!
